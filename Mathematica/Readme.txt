I plotted Twist-3 and Twist-4 CFFs by choosing the kinematic varibales like:
Q = 1.82; Subscript[x, B] = 0.34; M = 0.938272; k = 5.75; t = -0.17;\[Beta]=0.472936;y=0.496096;

In plotting the CFFs, I took t=0.17, which gives the answer of Twist-3 CFF in Imaginary form. So, I plotted Imaginary value of Twist-3 in Mathematica.

Whereas, I plotted Twist-3 with different values of Kinematic variables and compare their plots. The reference for these kinematic variables are listed on the Paper:arXiv:2109.10373v2 [hep-ph] 13 Dec 2021 (pg#23).
